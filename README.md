This is a simple streaming channel app.

It uses tools from `Livepeer`, `Push Notifications`, and `NFTPort`.
##

`Livepeer`
<br><br>
In the project I connect Streamlabs OBS to Livepeer and used the Livepeer `Player` to stream to my app landing page.

##

`Push Notifications`
<br><br>
First I created a channel on https://staging.push.org and then used the PushAPI to send notifications to the channel.

##

`NFTPort`
<br><br>
I used NFTPort to pull down my most recent uploads to IPFS using the NFTPortAPI.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
